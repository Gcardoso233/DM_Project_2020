# PVA Clustering

The project aims to analyze the data from The Paralyzed Veterans of America (PVA), a non-profit organization that provides programs and services for US veterans with spinal cord injuries or disease and is also one of the largest direct mail fundraisers in the United States of America.

A dataset was provided to analyse the results of one of the PVA’s latest fundraising appeals. Our task is to develop a Customer Segmentation in which we’ll be able to better understand how their donors behave and identify the different segments of donors/potential donors within their database.
